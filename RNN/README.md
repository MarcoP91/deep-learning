# RNN Projects

A serie of notebooks about experiments with Recurrent Neural Networks. <br>
DL libraries used: Tensorflow 1.x, Keras

Notebooks description:


 - **S&P500_prediction** : <br>
 Using Keras, this notebook builds several models, and tries to forecast the S&P500.
 - **shakespeare_char_prediction**: <br>
 Using Keras, this notebook builds a next charachter predictor model, trained on Shakespearean plays.
