# NLP Projects

A serie of notebooks about experiments with Natural Language Processing. <br>
DL libraries used: Tensorflow 1.x, Keras

Notebooks description:

 - **fine_tuning_flowers**: <br>
 Using Keras, this notebook fine-tunes a pretrained Inception CNN in order to classify flowers.
 - **image_segmentation_camvid**: <br>
 Using fastai and the Camvid dataset, this notebook implements a model that segments every pixel of an image into a class.
 - **show_activations**: <br>
 Using Keras and Grad-CAM, this notebook visualizes the parts of the images that were most relevant in the classification task.
 - **smiles_classifier**: <br>
 Using Keras, this notebook trains a model for telling whether a person is smiling or not, with a look at the intermediate layer of the model (activation maps).
 - **stimuli_visualization**: <br>
 Using Keras and the CIFAR10 dataset, this notebook implements a CNN classifier and plots images that causes the maximum value of the activation layers.
 - **visualize_activations**: <br>
 Using Keras, this notebook visualizes what a CNN trained on leopards thinks a leopard is.
