### Autoecoder Workshop

Using keras, this notebook builds autoencoders that:
- perform PCA on images (pass the images through the encoder and then try to recoinstruct them using condensed information).
- denoise images.
- given an image, retrieve similar (encoder-wise) images in the dataset.
- perform cheap image morphing.
